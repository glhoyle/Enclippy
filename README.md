Requires the cryptography module for Python3. Install using `pip install cryptography`.
Enclippy was created using Python version 3.7.

To run, download the most recent version of `Enclippy.py` into the directory your unencrypted files are located in. Choose your file, then run using `python3 Enclippy.py [filename] [password] [option]`.
To encrypt a file, use option `enclip`. To decrypt a file, use option `declip`.
Files to decrypt must have been encrypted on your machine, and require the correct password.

Happy enclipping!
